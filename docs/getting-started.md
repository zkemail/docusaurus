## ZK Email Project Repos

We have several repos within the ZK Email ecosystem. Developers can use these to build their own custom email verification circuits.

[ZK Email SDK](zk-email-sdk/README.md): Use this to build a new kind of ZK Email proofs out of the box with 8 lines of JSON, and automatically have proof infrastructure deployed for you. We recommend this for all developers new to ZK Email.

[ZK Email Verifier](zk-email-verifier/README.md): Build custom circuits, smart contracts, and frontend utils. This SDK will likely require ZK knowledge to be able to use, and gives more customizability than the [ZK Email SDK](zk-email-sdk/README.md).

[Email Wallet](email-wallet/README.md): A smart contract wallet controlled by your email. You can understand [how to hit the API](email-wallet/api-documentation.md) from a frontend easily, [run your own relayer](email-wallet/relayer-infrastructure.md) if you like, or [define your own extensions](email-wallet/email-wallet-extensions-sdk.md) to add functionality.

[Account Recovery](account-recovery/README.md): Explains the interfaces to call account recovery functions from a frontend API, and explains the smart contract architecture for wallets to customize. Used to enable and trigger recovery on any Safe or 7579-compatible wallet. Defines [Email Transaction Builder](email-tx-builder/README.md), which lets anyone write smart contracts that are triggered by emails.

[Oauth Login](login-with-zk-email-oauth-api.md):  Explains how to hit our APIs from a frontend to be able to login via emails with ZK Email, and optionally request scopes like temporary access to assets.

[ZK Regex](zk-regex.md): A library to do regex verification in circom. The zk-regex CLI takes in a regex and outputs a ZK circuit.

[Email Transaction Builder](email-tx-builder/README.md): A package that enables developers to integrate email-driven blockchain actions into their applications.

[JWT Transaction Builder](https://github.com/zkemail/email-tx-builder/): A package that enables anonymous verification of JWT signatures while masking specific claims.
