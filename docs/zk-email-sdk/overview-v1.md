# Overview

:::info
This is the documentation for the legacy ZK Email SDK. For the latest version, please see the [Blueprint SDK](/zk-email-sdk/) page.
:::

## Getting started

**Google Client API key**: You will need a Google OAuth token if you want users to be able to directly query emails from their inbox. Go to Google Cloud's dashboard to enable the Gmail API.

Learn how to create your `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` [here](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en).

**React Project**: The SDK currently only works with `reactjs`. If you are using `nextjs`, you might need some workarounds to make sure the page you integrate the SDK runs fully on the client side. Refer to this for reference [example](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-regex-registry).

## Wiring it up

Surround a page with the `ZkEmailSDKProvider` given by the SDK. If you are using `nextjs`, it is recommended that you only include this in a page that uses the SDK. Else, your entire application will need to be client-side rendered.

```jsx
import { ZkEmailSDKProvider } from "@zk-email/zk-email-sdk";

function TryPage(props: Props) {
  return (
    <ZkEmailSDKProvider clientId={GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID} zkEmailSDKRegistryUrl='https://registry-dev.zkregex.com'>
        <Page {...props}/>
    </ZkEmailSDKProvider>
  );
};
```

In your page, the SDK exposes a few hooks to interact with the library.

```jsx
export function Page(props: Props) {
    const {
        googleAuthToken,
        isGoogleAuthed,
        loggedInGmail,
        googleLogIn,
        googleLogOut,
    } = useGoogleAuth();

    const {
        createInputWorker,
        generateInputFromEmail,
        generateProofRemotely,
        proofStatus,
        inputWorkers
    } = useZkEmailSDK();
}
```

| Hook | Type | Arguments | Description |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| googleAuthToken | string | - | |
| isGoogleAuthed | boolean | - | |
| loggedInGmail | string | - | User's email |
| googleLogIn | method | - | Triggers the OAuth page for users to login |
| googleLogOut | method | - | Deletes the credentials stored in local browser |
| createInputWorker | method | pattern ID | Creates a worker in the background that processes emails into circuit inputs. This always happens on the client side. It downloads a worker script from the registry and runs it in a sandboxed WebWorker. |
| generateInputFromEmail | method | pattern ID, raw email | Returns the circuit input generated by processing the email provided |
| generateProofRemotely | method | pattern ID, circuit input | Uses the circuit input generated and queues a job. Circuit inputs are stored only before/during proof generation. This will automatically poll the server for updates. |
| proofStatus | `{[key:string]: ProofStatus}` | - | A map of proof job IDs and the current status + proof outputs. |
| inputWorkers | `{[key: string]: Worker}` | - | A map of input worker slugs and their associated web workers. |

```typescript
interface ProofStatus {
    status: string;
    id: string;
    pollUrl: string;
    estimatedTimeLeft: number;
    publicOutput: any;
    proof: any;
}
```

## Example integration

First, create an `inputWorker`:

```typescript
createInputWorker("<slug-name>");
```

Once the input worker is created, it will be populated in the `inputWorkers` variable. You can monitor this variable. As soon as the inputWorker is created, you can call the `generateProofRemotely` method:

```typescript
const [externalInputs, setExternalInputs] = useState<Record<string,string>>({});

// externalInputs - External inputs added when submitting a new pattern at https://registry-dev.zkregex.com/submit
const entryExternalInputs = externalInputs as {name: string, maxLength: number}[] || [];

for (const input of entryExternalInputs) {
    setExternalInputs({
        ...externalInputs,
        [input.name]: "",
    });
}

const input = await generateInputFromEmail(
  "<slug-name>",
  emailFull,
  externalInputs
);

const proofRes = await generateProofRemotely(
  "<slug-name>",
  input
);
```
