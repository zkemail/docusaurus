The Blueprint SDK is a TypeScript library that lets you integrate ZK Email verification into your applications. It handles all the cryptographic complexity - you just need to know regex patterns to specify what email fields to extract (like sender, subject, content). The SDK submits your pattern definitions to the [**Registry**](./registry.md).

The **Registry** takes care of compiling the ZK circuits and deploying verification contracts. This means you can quickly add email verification without dealing with any zero-knowledge cryptography implementation details.

## Core Features

The Blueprint SDK consists of three main features:

**Create Blueprint** lets you define email verification templates by specifying regex patterns and fields to extract from emails, along with proof parameters like public/private data visibility.

**Generate Proof** creates zero-knowledge proofs from emails based on blueprint specifications, proving authenticity and content claims without revealing the actual email.

**Verify Proof** validates proofs both off-chain and through smart contracts on-chain, allowing dApps to trustlessly verify email-based claims.
