# Overview

The ZK Email SDK enables developers to integrate Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs into applications for email verification without needing expertise in ZK technology. It abstracts away the complexities of zk-circuits, compiling, proving, and contract verification on the blockchain, allowing users to focus on their application logic.
