</div>

---

ZK Email utilizes **DKIM** (**DomainKeys Identified Mail**) as a key component in its architecture to enable trustless email verification on blockchain networks. This document explores how ZK Email uses the power of DKIM to achieve secure, privacy-preserving email authentication in decentralized environments.

We'll explore the fundamental aspects of DKIM, its role in email security, and how ZK Email uses this protocol to create a trustless solution for blockchain-based email verification. By understanding how DKIM and ZK Email work together, we can appreciate the foundation they provide for next-generation, trustless email authentication systems.

## What is DKIM?

DKIM is an email authentication protocol that allows the recipient to verify that an email was indeed sent and authorized by the owner of a specific domain. It does this by attaching a digital signature, linked to a domain name, to each outgoing email. The recipient's mail server can then validate this signature using the sender's public key published in the DNS records, ensuring the email hasn't been altered in transit.

### Key Features of DKIM

- **Authenticity:** Confirms that the email was sent by the claimed domain.
- **Integrity:** Ensures that the email content has not been tampered with during transmission.
- **Non-repudiation:** Provides evidence that the email originated from the stated domain.

## The DKIM Signature Process

The DKIM signing process involves several steps that work together to secure an email:

1. **Canonicalization:** The email's headers and body are standardized to a consistent format. This step accounts for any minor changes that might occur during transmission, such as line ending conversions.

2. **Hashing:** A cryptographic hash (usually SHA-256) is computed over the selected headers and the email body. Common headers included are `From`, `To`, `Subject`, and `Date`. The body hash (`bh`) is calculated separately and included in the `DKIM-Signature` header.

3. **Signing:** The hash of the headers is encrypted with the domain's private RSA key, creating the digital signature (`b` tag). The signature and related metadata are added to the email's `DKIM-Signature` header.

4. **DNS Publication:** The domain's public key is published in its DNS records under a specific selector, allowing recipients to retrieve it for signature verification.

### Example of a DKIM-Signature Header

```
DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; c=relaxed/relaxed;
 d=example.com; s=selector1; h=from:to:subject:date;
 bh=Base64(SHA256(body)); b=Base64(RSA-Signature);
```

- `v`: DKIM version.
- `a`: Algorithm used (e.g., `rsa-sha256`).
- `c`: Canonicalization method for header and body.
- `d`: Sending domain.
- `s`: Selector for locating the public key in DNS.
- `h`: Headers included in the hash.
- `bh`: Body hash.
- `b`: Signature.

## How DKIM Verification Works

When an email arrives at the recipient's mail server, DKIM verification occurs as follows:

1. **Public Key Retrieval:**
   - The server extracts the `d` (domain) and `s` (selector) from the `DKIM-Signature` header.
   - It queries the DNS for the corresponding public key.

2. **Hash Recalculation:**
   - The server canonicalizes the email headers and body using the same method as the sender.
   - It recalculates the hash over the specified headers and body.

3. **Signature Verification:**
   - Using the public key, the server decrypts the signature from the `b` tag.
   - It compares the decrypted signature to the recalculated hash.
   - If they match, the email passes DKIM verification; otherwise, it fails.

**Outcome:**

- **Pass:** The email is considered authentic and untampered.
- **Fail:** The email may be marked as spam, rejected, or subjected to further scrutiny.

## Why is DKIM Important?

DKIM plays a crucial role in email security and deliverability:

1. **Enhances Sender Reputation:**
   - Emails signed with DKIM appear more legitimate to receiving servers.
   - Over time, this builds a positive reputation for the sending domain, improving deliverability.

2. **Protects Against Spoofing:**
   - DKIM makes it significantly harder for malicious actors to send emails that appear to come from your domain.
   - It helps prevent phishing and spam campaigns that exploit domain spoofing.

3. **Integrates with Other Security Protocols:**
   - DKIM works in tandem with SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) to provide layered email security.

4. **Maintains Email Integrity:**
   - Ensures that the email content remains unchanged during transit, preserving the intended message.

## What is a DKIM Record?

A DKIM record is a specially formatted DNS TXT record that stores the public key used by receiving mail servers to verify an email's signature. It includes:

- **Selector (`s`):** A label that helps identify the correct public key when multiple keys are used.
- **Domain (`d`):** The domain associated with the email.
- **Public Key (`p`):** The RSA public key in Base64 encoding.

**Example of a DKIM DNS Record:**

```
selector1._domainkey.example.com IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=Base64(Public Key)"
```

- `selector1`: The selector specified in the `DKIM-Signature` header.
- `_domainkey`: A fixed prefix indicating a DKIM key.
- `v`: DKIM version.
- `k`: Key type (usually `rsa`).
- `p`: The public key.

## How ZK Email Uses DKIM

ZK Email leverages DKIM signatures to create zero-knowledge proofs about email contents without exposing sensitive information. The integration works as follows:

1. **Signature Verification in ZK Circuit:**
   - The zero-knowledge (ZK) circuit verifies the DKIM signature within the proof.
   - This ensures the email is authentic and unaltered without revealing the email's content.

2. **Email Structure Validation:**
   - The ZK circuit confirms that the email follows the correct structure of a DKIM-signed message.
   - It uses pattern matching (e.g., regular expressions) to validate headers and signature formats.

3. **Selective Content Proof:**
   - Specific email properties (e.g., sender domain, subject line, verification codes) can be proven without disclosing the entire email.
   - Users can demonstrate possession of certain information while keeping other parts private.

4. **On-chain Verification:**
   - The ZK proof is submitted to a smart contract on the blockchain.
   - The contract verifies the proof using the sender's public key from an on-chain registry.
   - Successful verification enables trustless interactions based on the email's validated properties.

## Advantages of DKIM for ZK Email

1. **Widespread Adoption:**
   - **Reliability:** Most modern email services implement DKIM, making it a stable foundation.

   - **Decentralized Trust:** Aligns with blockchain principles by enabling verification through cryptographic proofs.

3. **Privacy Preservation:**
   - **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Allows verification of email properties without revealing the actual content.
   - **Selective Disclosure:** Users have control over what information they share.

4. **Enhanced Security:**
   - **Integrity Assurance:** Confirms that the email hasn't been tampered with.
   - **Protection Against Spoofing:** Validates the sender's domain, reducing phishing risks.

5. **Flexible Applications:**
   - **Identity Verification:** Prove ownership of an email address without exposing it.
   - **Access Control:** Grant permissions based on verified email attributes.
   - **Confidential Communications:** Share proofs of sensitive information without disclosure.
