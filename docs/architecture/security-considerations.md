ZK Email's architecture is designed with security as a top priority. This document outlines the key security considerations, trust assumptions, and measures implemented in ZK Email to ensure a robust and trustworthy system for email verification on the blockchain.

## Trust Assumptions

While ZK Email significantly reduces trust requirements compared to traditional systems, it still relies on certain assumptions:

1. **DKIM Implementation**: We assume that email providers correctly implement DKIM signing and that their private keys remain secure.

2. **DNS Security**: The current system relies on DNS for fetching DKIM public keys, which introduces some trust in the DNS infrastructure.

3. **Cryptographic Assumptions**: The security of ZK Email depends on the underlying cryptographic primitives used in zero-knowledge proofs and DKIM signatures.

## Key Security Measures

### 1. Zero-Knowledge Proofs

- **Privacy Protection**: ZKPs allow verification of email properties without revealing the full content, protecting user privacy.
- **Selective Disclosure**: Users can choose which parts of an email to prove, minimizing unnecessary data exposure.

### 2. On-chain DKIM Public Key Registry

- **Trustless Verification**: By maintaining an on-chain registry of DKIM public keys, ZK Email reduces reliance on potentially manipulable DNS lookups.
- **Key Rotation Handling**: The system includes mechanisms to securely update DKIM public keys, addressing the challenge of key rotation.

### 3. Signature Verification

- **Robust Checking**: The ZK circuits perform thorough checks on DKIM signatures, ensuring their validity and integrity.
- **Timestamp Verification**: The system verifies email timestamps to prevent the use of outdated or future-dated emails.

### 4. Smart Contract Security

- **Audited Contracts**: All smart contracts used in ZK Email undergo rigorous security audits.
- **Upgrade Mechanisms**: Carefully designed upgrade paths allow for security improvements while maintaining system integrity.

## Potential Attack Vectors and Mitigations

### 1. DNS Spoofing

- **Risk**: An attacker could potentially manipulate DNS responses to provide false DKIM public keys.
- **Mitigation**: The on-chain DKIM public key registry reduces reliance on real-time DNS lookups. Future implementations may incorporate DNSSEC for additional security.

### 2. Compromised Email Accounts

- **Risk**: If an attacker gains access to a user's email account, they could potentially generate proofs for that account.
- **Mitigation**: ZK Email doesn't increase the risk beyond what already exists with compromised email accounts. Users are encouraged to maintain strong email security practices.

### 3. Replay Attacks

- **Risk**: An attacker might try to reuse a valid proof for multiple verifications.
- **Mitigation**: Proofs can be designed to include unique challenge data or timestamps, preventing reuse across different contexts or time periods.

### 4. Front-running

- **Risk**: In blockchain contexts, there's a potential for front-running attacks where an attacker observes a proof submission and tries to use it for their benefit.
- **Mitigation**: Application-specific smart contracts should be designed with this risk in mind, potentially incorporating commit-reveal schemes or other anti-front-running measures.

## Ongoing Security Efforts

1. **Regular Audits**: The ZK Email system undergoes regular security audits by third-party experts.

2. **Open Source**: The core components of ZK Email are open source, allowing for community review and contribution.

3. **Bounty Programs**: Bug bounty programs incentivize the discovery and responsible disclosure of potential vulnerabilities.

4. **Continuous Improvement**: The ZK Email team actively researches and implements new security measures as the cryptographic landscape evolves.

## Conclusion

While ZK Email significantly enhances the security and privacy of email-based blockchain interactions, users and developers should be aware of the underlying trust assumptions and potential risks. By understanding these security considerations, the community can make informed decisions and contribute to the ongoing improvement of the ZK Email ecosystem.
