# Generic Relayer

The **Generic Relayer** allows developers to integrate email-driven actions into their blockchain applications seamlessly. By interacting with a specific API endpoint, you can trigger the execution of commands defined in a smart contract via email. The relayer handles the email verification process, zero-knowledge proof generation, and the execution of the command on the blockchain, simplifying development and enhancing security.

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the architecture, including detailed technical aspects of an end-to-end implementation deployed on the Sepolia testnet.


## Architecture Overview

![Generic Relayer Architecture Diagram](/img/generic-relayer-architecture.png)

The architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **Client Application**: Initiates the process by sending a request to the generic relayer's API.
2. **Generic Relayer**: Manages API requests, sends and receives emails, generates zero-knowledge proofs, and interacts with the blockchain.
3. **EmailAuth.sol Contract**: Defines the commands that can be executed via email authentication.
4. **Command Implementation Contract**: Uses `EmailAuth.sol` to execute specific commands and handle events.
5. **SMTP/IMAP Servers**: Used by the relayer for email communication.
6. **Blockchain Network**: Where smart contracts are deployed and transactions are executed.
7. **DKIM Registry**: Manages DKIM public keys for email verification.
8. **Database**: Stores request statuses and tracks expected email replies.

## Components

### Client Application

- **Purpose**: The entry point for users or other systems to initiate email-driven commands.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Constructs API requests with necessary parameters.
  - Sends requests to the Generic Relayer's API endpoints.
  - Monitors request statuses and handles responses.

### Generic Relayer

- **Purpose**: The core server that orchestrates the entire email-driven command execution process.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handles incoming API requests.
  - Sends emails to users and receives replies.
  - Generates zero-knowledge proofs for email verification.
  - Interacts with the blockchain to execute commands.
  - Manages request tracking and status updates.

### EmailAuth.sol Contract

- **Purpose**: Smart contract that handles email authentication and command template management.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Stores and manages command templates.
  - Authenticates emails using DKIM and zero-knowledge proofs.
  - Ensures commands match expected templates.
  - Prevents replay attacks using nullifiers.

### Command Implementation Contract (e.g., EmitEmailCommand.sol)

- **Purpose**: Implements specific command logic using `EmailAuth.sol`.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Defines and manages command templates.
  - Handles command execution upon successful email authentication.
  - Interacts with `EmailAuth.sol` for email verification.
  - Emits events or performs actions based on commands.

## Key Concepts

### EmailAuth.sol Contract

The `EmailAuth.sol` contract is central to the authentication process. It manages command templates, verifies email proofs, and ensures that commands are executed only after proper authentication.

**Key Components**:

- **Command Templates**: Stored in a mapping with unique `templateId`.

  ```solidity
  mapping(uint => string[]) public commandTemplates;
  ```

- **Authentication Function**:

  ```solidity
  function authEmail(EmailAuthMsg memory emailAuthMsg) public onlyController {
      // Verification logic...
  }
  ```

- **Access Control**: Only the `controller` can call certain functions, enhancing security.

### Command Templates

Command templates define the structure of commands that can be authenticated and executed. They consist of fixed strings and placeholders for parameters.

**Example**:

```solidity
function commandTemplates() public pure returns (string[][] memory) {
    string[][] memory templates = new string[][](1);
    templates[0] = new string[](3);
    templates[0][0] = "Authorize";
    templates[0][1] = "address";
    templates[0][2] = "{ethAddr}";
    return templates;
}
```

Command templates support various matcher types like `{string}`, `{uint}`, `{int}`, `{decimals}`, and `{ethAddr}` for capturing different types of data. For a comprehensive guide on command templates and available matchers, see the [Command Templates](./command-templates) documentation.

### EmailAuthMsg Structure

The `EmailAuthMsg` struct contains all the necessary information required for email authentication and command execution.

```solidity
struct EmailAuthMsg {
    uint templateId;
    bytes[] commandParams;
    uint skippedCommandPrefix;
    EmailProof proof;
}
```

- **templateId**: The ID of the command template.

- **commandParams**: Parameters extracted from the email, matching the placeholders in the command template.

- **skippedCommandPrefix**: Number of characters skipped in the command, used for partial matching.

- **proof**: An `EmailProof` struct containing the zero-knowledge proof and related data.

### EmailProof Structure

The `EmailProof` struct contains data required to verify the email's authenticity and integrity using zero-knowledge proofs.

```solidity
struct EmailProof {
    string domainName;
    bytes32 publicKeyHash;
    uint256 timestamp;
    string maskedCommand;
    bytes32 emailNullifier;
    bytes32 accountSalt;
    bool isCodeExist;
    bytes proof;
}
```

- **domainName**: The email sender's domain.

- **publicKeyHash**: Hash of the DKIM public key used for email verification.

- **timestamp**: Timestamp of the email, used for freshness checks.

- **maskedCommand**: The command extracted from the email, potentially masked for privacy.

- **emailNullifier**: A unique identifier to prevent replay attacks.

- **accountSalt**: Used with `CREATE2` for deterministic contract deployment.

- **isCodeExist**: Indicates if the code exists in the email body.

- **proof**: The actual zero-knowledge proof bytes.

### Verifier and DKIM Registry

- **Verifier Contract**: Used to verify zero-knowledge proofs on-chain. It ensures that the email proof provided is valid without revealing sensitive information.

- **DKIM Registry Contract**: Stores and manages DKIM public keys for different domains. Used to verify that an email was indeed sent from the claimed domain.

### AccountSalt and CREATE2 Deployment

- **AccountSalt**: A unique value derived from the user's email address and an account code. Used to compute deterministic contract addresses.

- **CREATE2 Deployment**: A method in Solidity that allows for the deployment of contracts to deterministic addresses. This is crucial for predicting the `EmailAuth` contract address without prior deployment.
